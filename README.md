ðŸ“˜ Book Suggestion App - README


This is my final project for the Python certification course. I created a simple book suggestion app using Python. It uses the Google Books API to get real book data, filters the results based on user input, and gives a random book recommendation.


âœ… What This App Does

- Takes your favorite genre as input
- Lets you filter books by rating and publication year
- Gets real book data from the internet (Google Books)
- Shows one random book based on your filters

ðŸ§ª How to Run the App


1. Install Python Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, open your terminal or command prompt and install the libraries:
pip install requests pandas
2. Save the Code
Copy the code from book_suggestion_app.py and save it in your project folder.
3. Run the App
In the terminal, go to your project folder and run:
python book_suggestion_app.py
4. Follow the Prompts

- Type in a genre like fiction, romance, or science.
- You can enter a minimum rating (like 4) or skip it.
- You can also enter a year like 2020 or skip that too.
Then the app will show you one book suggestion!
